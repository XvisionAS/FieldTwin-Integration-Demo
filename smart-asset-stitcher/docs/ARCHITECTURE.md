# Architecture & rationale

This document explains how the stitcher works and **proves** the central design
decision: that the API's `transformMatrix` can be applied directly to each part GLB.

## Data model

A FieldTwin **staged smart asset** (from the v1.10 API) has:

- `asset` — the base object: `model3dUrl`, `dockingMales[]` (each `{ name, matrix }`),
  `dockingFemale` (`{ name, matrix }`), and geometry params. This is the root model the
  docked parts attach to. Unlike the parts it has **no `transformMatrix`** — its placement
  is the staged-asset top-level `initialState` (see "The base object" below).
- `initialState` — the staged asset's own world placement: `{ x, y, z, scale, rotation,
  xRotation, yRotation }`. These are the base object's world coords and orientation.
- `metaData[]` — a recursive tree of nodes of `type: "asset"`. Each node:
  - `model3dUrl` — signed GLB URL for that part,
  - `docking` — the docking slot name (e.g. `"001"`),
  - `params.initialState.transformMatrix` — **16-element, column-major, absolute world**
    4×4 matrix giving that part's final placement,
  - `params.initialState.{x,y,z,rotation,xRotation,yRotation,zRotation}` — scalar form,
  - `subValue[]` — child parts (same shape, recursive; observed up to ~7 deep).
- The deepest leaf terminates with empty `params: {}` and no `model3dUrl`.

### Why we use `transformMatrix` and not the euler fields

The scalar `xRotation/yRotation/zRotation` fields are **correction-stripped** by the API
(it multiplies by `modelCorrectionMatrixInverse` only when extracting euler angles).
`transformMatrix` is NOT stripped — it contains the full, render-ready transform. Use it.

### The base object (synthesizing its matrix)

The docked `metaData` parts each carry an API `transformMatrix`, but the **base object**
(`stagedAsset.asset`) does not — the live renderer places its GLB at the staged-asset root
and applies the +90°X correction there (proof point 4 below). So `src/matrix.js`
reproduces the matrix the API *would* have built for a node with no docking, in the same
stack order proven below:

```
M = correction(+90°X) · translation(x, z, −y) · headingⒷ · yRotⒷ · xRotⒷ · scaleⒷ
```

where `(x, y, z, rotation, xRotation, yRotation, scale)` come from the top-level
`initialState`. The FieldTwin→three axis swap (`x, z, −y`) combined with the correction
makes the final translation column equal the world `(x, y, z)`.

**Verified empirically:** a real docked part whose euler angles are all ~0 has the matrix
`correction · translation(x, z, −y)` exactly; feeding that part's `initialState` through
`stagedAssetRootMatrix()` reproduces its API matrix to ~1e-6. Real bases observed so far
are rotation-free (`rotation = xRotation = yRotation = 0`), so only translation +
correction are exercised end-to-end; the heading/tilt terms follow the documented stack
order but a rotated base has not yet been checked against a live render.

## The pipeline

```
descriptor.json
   │  loadDescriptor + validate           (src/descriptor.js)
   ▼
fetchStagedAsset(id)                       (src/apiClient.js)
   │  GET /API/v1.10/{proj}/subProject/{sub}:{stream}/stagedAssets/{id}
   ▼
flattenParts(stagedAsset)                  (src/treeWalker.js)
   │  emit the base object (synthesized matrix, see below), then walk metaData +
   │  subValue, keeping nodes with model3dUrl AND a 16-len matrix
   │  → [{ assetName, partId, docking, model3dUrl, transformMatrix, localPath:null }]
   ▼
downloadAll(parts, outDir)                 (src/downloader.js)
   │  bounded pool (8), dedup identical URLs, retry x3, populate localPath
   ▼
buildGlb(parts, outPath)                   (src/stitcher.js)
   │  for each part: merge its GLB, re-home roots under a node, node.setMatrix(matrix)
   │  all part nodes are SIBLINGS under one `fieldtwin-root` node (−90°X frame conversion)
   │  strip editor-only helper nodes (docking sockets, tags); prune orphans
   ▼
buildDescription(...) + write              (src/description.js, src/run.js)
   → stitched.glb + description.json
```

## Proof: the matrix is directly applicable (no correction, no transpose)

The FieldTwin v1.9/v1.10 API builds each part's `transformMatrix` by multiplying a
matrix stack. The stack is **seeded with the model-correction rotation**, then world
placement, then per-part docking matrices. Traced in the monorepo:

1. `common/libraries/three/utils/modelQuaternion.js:5`
   ```js
   modelCorrectionQuaternion = new Quaternion().setFromAxisAngle(new Vector3(1,0,0), Math.PI*0.5)
   ```
   The model→FieldTwin correction is a +90° rotation about X.

2. `backends/fieldtwinapi/routes/API.v1.9/subProject/API.utils.v1.9.subProject.outputs.js:30-73`
   ```js
   const initialMatrix = new Matrix4().makeRotationFromQuaternion(modelCorrectionQuaternion)
   // ...
   const matrices = [initialMatrix, translation, headingMatrix, yMatrix, xMatrix, scaleMatrix]
   options.matrices = matrices   // passed into per-metaData computation
   ```
   The correction is pushed **first**, then world translation (note the FieldTwin↔three
   axis swap at `makeTranslation(wp.x, wp.z, -wp.y)`), heading, rotations, scale.

3. `backends/fieldtwinapi/routes/API.v1.9/API.utils.v1.9.output.js:330-378`
   The per-metaDatum routine extends that stack with the docking male/female matrices,
   multiplies the whole list, and stores the result:
   ```js
   output.params.initialState.transformMatrix = matrix.toArray()
   ```
   It then recurses into `subValue`, passing the accumulated stack down — so **every
   nested part's matrix already includes the correction + the full ancestor chain.**

4. `common/libraries/three/visualizer/objects/StagedAssetMesh.js:982`
   In the live renderer the correction is applied **once, at the staged-asset root**
   (`this.quaternion.multiply(modelCorrectionQuaternion)`), and the loaded GLB scene is
   used as-is. The API output achieves the equivalent by baking the correction into each
   part matrix instead. **The two representations are equivalent.**

### Conclusions

- **Absolute, not relative.** Each matrix is the full product root→part. Therefore part
  nodes must be **siblings** under the scene root — nesting would apply ancestor
  transforms twice.
- **Direct application.** `Node.setMatrix(array)` in `@gltf-transform` expects the same
  16-element column-major layout produced by three.js `matrix.toArray()`. No transpose.
- **No extra correction.** The +90°X correction and axis swap are already inside the
  matrix. Re-applying them would double-rotate the model.

## How `buildGlb` merges (gltf-transform v4)

```js
const doc = new Document()
const scene = doc.createScene('stitched')
const frameRoot = doc.createNode('fieldtwin-root').setMatrix(FIELDTWIN_TO_GLTF) // −90°X
scene.addChild(frameRoot)
for (const part of parts) {
  const partDoc = await io.read(part.localPath)
  mergeDocuments(doc, partDoc)                        // v4: was doc.merge(partDoc)
  const merged = doc.getRoot().listScenes().at(-1)    // the just-merged scene
  const node = doc.createNode(part.partId)
  node.setMatrix(part.transformMatrix)
  for (const root of merged.listChildren()) { merged.removeChild(root); node.addChild(root) }
  frameRoot.addChild(node)                            // siblings under the frame root
  merged.dispose()                                    // drop the now-empty merged scene
}
doc.getRoot().setDefaultScene(scene)
stripHelperNodes(doc)                                 // docking sockets + tags
await doc.transform(prune(), unpartition())           // drop orphans; one GLB buffer
await io.write(outPath, doc)
```

`mergeDocuments()` (v4 replacement for `doc.merge()`) copies all of `partDoc`'s resources
into `doc` and appends its scene(s); we take the last-added scene, re-home its root nodes
under one matrix node, and discard the empty scene. Identical part URLs are downloaded once
(deduped by the downloader) but each node still gets its own matrix. `unpartition()` is
required because GLB allows only 0–1 buffers and each merged part brought its own.

### Frame conversion and helper stripping

- **`fieldtwin-root` (−90°X).** API matrices are FieldTwin world coords (Z-up, +90°X model
  correction baked in). glTF/three viewers are Y-up. A single root node applies −90°X to the
  whole assembly — the same node FieldTwin's own `THREE.GLTFExporter` emits at the top of
  `real-coord.gltf`. It is a coordinate-frame conversion applied once, NOT a per-part
  rotation; the part matrices are untouched.
- **Helper stripping.** Part GLBs embed editor-only geometry: docking-socket markers
  (`docking_male_NNN`, `docking_female_NNN`) and tags (`tag_NNN`). The FieldTwin export drops
  them; `buildGlb` strips nodes matching `/^(docking_male|docking_female|tag)_/i` by default
  (`keepHelpers: true` to retain), then `prune()` removes the orphaned meshes/accessors.

## Verifying correctness

The proof above is a static trace. Confirmed against reality:

- **Against the FieldTwin export.** `real-coord.gltf` is a THREE.GLTFExporter dump of the same
  staged asset. Matching per-mesh world centroids (in the viewer frame), all 9 of our model
  meshes (base + 8 parts) coincide with the reference to ~3e-5. The reference's only extra
  mesh is a standalone scene object (`node 28`) outside the staged asset.
- **Numerical:** for each part, the world-space centroid of its geometry sits at the API's
  reported `x/y/z`, which equal `transformMatrix[12]`, `[13]`, `[14]`.
- **Visual (still worth a glance):** open `stitched.glb` in any glTF viewer; it should be
  upright and match the in-app render (no surprise 90° flip).
